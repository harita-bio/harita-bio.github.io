        What began as simple curiosity soon turned into a full-fledged journey
        into the intricacies of biology and computer science. Having spent much
        of my life immersed in technology and the climate of automation, I
        reached a point where I wanted my skills to ripple into something more
        meaningful. Something that could bring hope. For me, that direction is
        bioinformatics, particularly genomics.

        Genomics feels like standing at the frontier of discovery: every dataset
        is a window into how life works, every variant a clue in the story of
        health and disease. Through my first projects like building evidence
        tables for genetic variants and analyzing genome-wide associations in
        epilepsy, I’ve seen how data can become insight, and how even small
        steps can connect back to the bigger human questions.

        In this column, I am tracking my growth in bioinformatics: a space where
        I share the insights I gain and the awe I feel. It’s a journey into
        something so small, so simple, so common, yet an unexplored mine of
        answers to our lives. Each project is both a technical step forward and
        a reminder of the wonder hidden inside our cells, waiting to be
        discovered.
